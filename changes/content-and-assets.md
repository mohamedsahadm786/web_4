>
> **Why this file exists.** It is the hand-off document for spinning up a *new

> - drop in the existing `src/images/` folder as-is and have Claude wire each
>   image to its slot just by reading the file names (see §6–§7);
> - see exactly which copy is placeholder text, so it can be swapped for the
>   new site's wording section by section.

## 6. Image asset system — how it works

The whole site loads real images from one place: **`src/images/`**, organised
into one sub-folder per section. There is no manual import list.

**Resolver — `src/lib/images.ts`:** `import.meta.glob` eagerly imports every
file under `src/images/**`. It builds a lookup keyed by `"<folder>/<name>"`
**without the extension**, lower-cased.

**`<Img>` component — `src/components/Img.tsx`:** given `name="folder/name"`
(no extension) it renders:
- the real photo if a matching file exists;
- a looping muted `<video>` if the file is a video;
- a sized grey `<Placeholder>` if no file exists yet.
Props: `fit` (`cover` | `contain`), `rounded`, `tint`, `fallback`, `className`.

**Naming rules:**
- Lower-case, no spaces, exact name from the tables in §7.
- The **extension may be anything** supported — only the name must match.
- Supported: `png, jpg, jpeg, webp, avif, svg` (images) and `mp4, webm, mov`
  (videos — they autoplay, muted, looping).
- Drop a correctly-named file in the folder → it appears, **no code change**.
  Remove it → the placeholder returns.

## 7. Image folders — what goes where

One folder per area. To place an image, save it into the folder with the
exact name below (any supported extension).

### `logo/`
| Name        | Used for                              | Notes |
|-------------|---------------------------------------|-------|
| `site-logo` | Header, footer, and search-bar logo   | If absent, a `LUMA` wordmark shows. Transparent PNG/SVG best. |

### `hero/` — home page top section
| Name                          | Used for                                | Notes |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------|
| `home-hero-background-image`   | Full-bleed parallax background of the hero | Wide / landscape, dark. |
| `home-hero-product-image`      | Floating product render on the right     | PNG with transparency ideal. |

### `about/` — About section
Three media items that **cycle clockwise** through the three About tiles. Each
may be an image **or a video** (`.mp4` / `.webm` / `.mov` autoplay muted loop).
| Name                       | Used for          |
|----------------------------|-------------------|
| `video`                    | Cycling media #1  |
| `home-about-stat-image`    | Cycling media #2  |
| `home-about-small-image`   | Cycling media #3  |

### `testimonials/` — testimonial avatars
Square images, shown inside a circle.
| Name                              | Person        |
|-----------------------------------|---------------|
| `home-testimonial-michael-reed`   | Michael Reed  |
| `home-testimonial-emily-carter`   | Emily Carter  |
| `home-testimonial-sofia-bennett`  | Sofia Bennett |

### `extra/` — images used across the page
| Name  | Used for                                                  |
|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `E_1` | Image tile in the Features row (below the hero)           |
| `E_2` | Full-bleed background of the "Let's Talk To" CTA section  |
| `E_3` | Full-width banner image in the "Get in Touch" section     |

### `products/` — one image per product
One file per product, named exactly after the **slug** (see §5). Shown on the
Shop grid, the Products section, the Product page, and search results.
Current products are **3:2 landscape** photos (e.g. 2048×1368, 4500×3000).

`bpc-157-tb-500-40mg` · `nad-1000mg` · `glow-70mg` · `retatrutide-20mg` ·
`retatrutide-40mg` · `tirzepatide-20mg` · `tirzepatide-40mg` · `tirzepatide-5mg`

### `product-gallery/` — 4 thumbnails per product
On a product page the main image has **4 thumbnails** below it; clicking one
flips the main image. Four files per product, named `<slug>_1` … `<slug>_4`
(32 files for 8 products). Same 3:2 landscape ratio as `products/`.

Example for BPC-157: `bpc-157-tb-500-40mg_1`, `_2`, `_3`, `_4`.

## 8. Placing images in a new recreation project

When the `src/images/` folder is copied into a new repo:

1. **Keep the folder structure** (`logo/ hero/ about/ testimonials/ extra/
   products/ product-gallery/`) — the resolver and every `<Img>` slot depend
   on these folder names.
2. **Match file names to slots** using the tables in §7. The name (not the
   extension) is what matters.
3. If the new site has **different products**, rename the `products/` and
   `product-gallery/` files to the new slugs, and update `src/lib/products.ts`
   so its `slug` values match the file names.
4. Any slot with no file just shows a grey placeholder — nothing breaks, so
   images can be filled in gradually.
5. Product images look best as a **consistent aspect ratio** (this build uses
   3:2 landscape; the product gallery is `aspect-[3/2]` with `fit="contain"`).
